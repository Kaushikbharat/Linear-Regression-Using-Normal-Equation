In this repository you can find detailed implemenation of Linear Regression using Normal Equation via R , mtcars Data has been used to build Linear Regression and tried comparing the results using the inbuilt lm function.
I tried understanding the actual math behind the linear regression and then implemented it using Normal Equation
majorly the concepts has been taken from Andrew NG course of machine Learning
